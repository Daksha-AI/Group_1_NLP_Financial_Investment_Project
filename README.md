Our project aims to build FinSight, a multi-agent AI system that autonomously analyzes financial news to generate market insights and support investment decision-making. The system uses specialized agents to gather and process news data, classify sentiment and market events, summarize key developments, and evaluate their potential market impact. By implementing prompt chaining, routing, and evaluator–optimizer workflows, FinSight demonstrates how agentic AI can replicate real-world financial research pipelines, providing actionable insights for investors.

This dataset contains thousands of financial news articles paired with market event labels, making it ideal for news-based investment analysis. It includes key variables such as publication date, news title, full article text, event type, and sentiment. The dataset’s size provides sufficient coverage for training and evaluating news classification, sentiment analysis, and summarization tasks. Its structure supports multi-agent workflows that connect textual market signals with investment research insights. _____
